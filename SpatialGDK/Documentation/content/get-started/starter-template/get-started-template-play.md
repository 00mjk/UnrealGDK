# The Starter Template

## 4. Play the game

To get playing, you use SpatialOS Launcher to set up clients for users. You then share the clients with users via a dedicated URL.

<%(#Expandable title="Reminder: What is the SpatialOS Launcher?")%>

The Launcher is a distribution tool which downloads and launches game clients for your deployment. You installed the Launcher when you [installed SpatialOS on your machine]({{urlRoot}}/content/get-started/dependencies#step-3-software). You access the Launcher from the Console; use it to create a URL to give end-users access to a game client for your game.
